- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Jimenez. @michael-jimenez13
- 👀 I’m interested in developing sensors and applying concurrent AI tools to enhace technoligcal capabilities on brain informatics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer vision, coarse graining, neural networks, and deep learning (using pytorch and tensorflow). I have a wide variety of interest from genomes, molecular structures in mosfets, computer  design/architecture, neuroscience, analog design, three-dimensional structures of proteins, neuromorphic computinng, space-time theorems, brain computer interface,  the world of micro-cosmos, robotoc design, and much more .  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the existing pathways to adopting advanced sensor detection on the brain and as well other health related issues. However, I have wide array of interests and keen to solving puzzles/problems.
