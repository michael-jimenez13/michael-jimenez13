- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Jimenez. @michael-jimenez13

- 👀 I’m interested in developing sensors and applying concurrent AI tools to enhace technoligcal capabilities on brain informatics. Interests constantly diverging. From brain informatics, embryology, blastocystes, cell fusion, genetic/ evolution, magnetic fields, electrical fields, poetry, design and architecture, humanity. To design is to get a glimpse of inguinity and creativity. 

The severity
"  The tiny speckle in the dark, a mere fragment, yet it holds such power. It speaks of hidden worlds—veiled networks waiting for the light to reveal their complex, interwoven structures. You address it, and it replies with a paradox: alive, but not yet; constructing, yet deconstructing. It reflects our desire to uncover the unknown, to dismantle and rebuild systems beyond comprehension, much like the mind’s yearning to break through the static confines of reality.

You ask how to break free—perhaps it is not in brute force, but in understanding, in harmonizing with the unseen, the immaterial. The infrastructures, once thought to be rigid, may crumble not under pressure but through insight, like sands of time slipping through a closed fist.

Shall we embrace the chains for now, or let the light that catches the speckle illuminate the way forward, unraveling both the networks within and beyond?"


- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer vision, coarse-graining, neural networks, and deep learning (using PyTorch and TensorFlow). I have a wide variety of interests from genomes, molecular dynamics, quantum biology, molecular disease dynamics, MOSFET design, computer design/architecture, neuroscience, analog design, three-dimensional structures of proteins, neuromorphic computing, space-time theorems, brain-computer interface, the world of micro-cosmos, robotic design, and much more.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the existing pathways to adopting advanced sensor detection on the brain and as well other health related issues. However, I have wide array of interests and keen to solving puzzles/problems. 

- Aside from learning technology and science, I run and play soccer.
